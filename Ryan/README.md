GLMBoosted Regression on Event Free Survival Time 

Input data was cleaned and prepared as outlined on the main README. 

WT dataset (https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/RNAseq_Cancer_Biomarkers/blob/master/scripts/WT_assay_clinical.csv.zip)

First distribution of Event Free Survial Time in Days (EFST) was plotted and the median (331 days) calculated.  The data was then bisected on the median into two cohorts. ( Then each normalized gene expression data was averaged for each cohort and the
